### Hi, I'm Timur 👋  
Full-Stack Developer | ML & Computer Vision Student | Automation Engineer

I'm a software engineer with hands-on experience in business automation and backend development, now expanding into applied machine learning and computer vision.

Recently completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science at York University, and now I'm focused on delivering two end-to-end capstone projects demonstrating practical ML skills, problem-solving, and model deployment.

### 🚀 Working On

- 📊 **Machine Learning Capstone** — full data science pipeline:
  - Problem framing, data exploration & visualization
  - Model development & comparison
  - Hyperparameter tuning & evaluation
  - Business use-case understanding & communication
  - Deployment & documentation

- 🩺 **Computer Vision Capstone — GI Cancer Detection**
  - CNNs, Vision Transformers, Transfer Learning
  - Handling imbalanced datasets
  - Sensitivity, specificity, recall, precision, F1
  - Balancing techniques (oversampling, SMOTE, ADASYN)
  - Comparing architectures & real-world implications

- 📁 Recovering & organizing selected past work (Bitrix automation scripts)  
  *(will publish simplified versions once collected and anonymized)*

---

### 🎯 Goals for Nov-Dec 2025

- ✅ Complete **ML Capstone**
- ✅ Complete **Computer Vision Capstone (GI pathology classification)**
- 📄 Publish detailed READMEs, diagrams, and Jupyter notebooks
- 📊 Present model results & business interpretations
- 🤖 Start building ML deployment skills (FastAPI / Streamlit / HuggingFace Spaces)
- 🌐 Publish a personal portfolio page showcasing projects

### 📂 Featured Projects (In Progress)

- 🧠 **Machine Learning Capstone**
  *End-to-end ML solution with EDA → models → tuning → business insights*

- 🩺 **Gastrointestinal Cancer Classification (CV Capstone)**
  *CNN, ViT, Transfer Learning, imbalance handling, evaluation & comparison*

- (Coming Soon) **Bitrix Automation Showcase (open-source version)**  
  *(Once previous project files are retrieved, cleaned & anonymized)*
